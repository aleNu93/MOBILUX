# 📱 Mobilux

Mobilux is a mobile application developed as an academic project, focused on the **financial management of high-value furniture purchases acquired through financing**. The application allows an individual client to maintain a clear and structured record of outstanding balances, payments made, and the overall status of financed purchases.

The project simulates a real commercial financing environment by incorporating realistic market conditions such as minimum down payments, defined repayment terms, and interest rates, all within a practical and professionally structured framework.
